title: "Site Update: New Help System"
---
One of the aspects of the site that we have been spending a lot of time on lately is our help system. One of the aspects that we really like about Ride With GPS is how personal it is. Our members can always contact us directly and we do our best to get back to everyone as quickly as possible. 

However, one of the things we have noticed for awhile is that we are spending a lot of time each day or week answer the same or very similar questions. What this told us is that we hadn't done a good job making answers available to our members on the site. And, as hard as we try to make our tool simple and easy to use there are always questions so we wanted to provide those more readily on the site. 

With this in mind we set out to build our first Help page!

We also wanted to update Feedback

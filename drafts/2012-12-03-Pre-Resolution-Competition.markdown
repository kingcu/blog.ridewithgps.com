While we start to turn out thoughts to the new year and the resolutions we will be making for 2013 we figured that thereâ€™s nothing better to do in December, but get a jump on things with a pre-resolution challenge. Starting on the 8th participants in this competition will be challenged to battle the elements and the short days in an effort to start the new year off rolling!

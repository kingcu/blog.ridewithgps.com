title: "Quick Tip: Pressure Washing!"
---
In some ways bicycles are a lot like cars. They require a lot of up keep. There's no denying that one of the best things you can do as a car or bicycle owner is preventative maintenance. One of the things I have learned over the last 10yrs of being a competitive triathlete and now cyclist is that the best thing you can do on the preventative maintenance war front is washing your bike. 

Washing your bike may seem like a basic and easy concept. But this is not always the case. Some mechanics recomend that you wash your bike afer every ride. Others say that just keeping your drive train clean is whats most important, and that if you take 15 seconds after every ride to spin the chain through a wrag you can dramatically increse the lifetime of your chain, cogs, and cassette not to mention that you'll have a smoother and quieter ride. However, what I found is that this is all way easier said then done. 

There are plenty of limiting factors that can prevent someone from this type of care for their bike. Some of those factors are the obvious one time! For those of us who have a full time career, competitive schedule, and family time is always going to be presous comodity and is easily always the first excuse to why we don't take better care of our bikes. Additionally though, there are other factors that I didn't learn about until recently. 

If you currently live in, or have ever lived in an apartment one of the key tools that you need for washing your bike is not available. A hose! Shockingly enough you need water and some pressure to be able to sufficently clean a bike. The best and cheapest way around this conondrum is a 1 gallon pesticide sprayer. 

<img align="right" src="/images/post_images/pesticide_sprayer.jpeg">I like the 1 gallon size because it's small enough to fit under a kitchen sink, and 1 gallon turns out to be the perfect amount of water to clean one to two bikes without having to refil. Another nice part about the sprayer is that you can fill it with super hot water, which on a cold winter day can be the difference between washing your bike and not. Since sprayers are so portable they are also super easy to pack in the car for a race, ride, or bike trip. If I drive to mountain bike I don't leave home without the sprayer, because I like to ride through water and mud when I mountain bike and the sprayer lets me clean off my bike, shoes, and clothes at the trailhead. 

Sprayers also super cheap. I think I paid right around $10 at my local hardware store. As far as value per dollar spent, it's one of the best tools I have ever bought.

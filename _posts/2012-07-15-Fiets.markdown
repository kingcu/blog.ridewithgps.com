<img style="float:left;" src="/images/post_images/fiets.png"> A short while back we added some new metrics to segment pages. One of those metrics was "fiets", and we've received several inquires regarding this metric, so we want give an explanation on what this metric is and what it means to you.

The short explanation of fiets is that it is a dificulty rating for a climb. However, the short explanation doesn't really give this rating system enough credit.

The long explanation is that fiets differs from the category rating scale because it take more factors into the equation. Here's the equestion:

fietsIndex = h&#42;h / (d&#42;10) + (t > 1000 ? (t-1000)/1000.0 :0)

Where: 

- h = max elevation - min elevation
- d = metric distance
- t = max Elevation

Since this equation takes steepness into the equation you will sometimes find that a long shallow climb that is still a Cat HC or Cat 1 may not rate highly on Fiets. Transversely, a climb that is shorter and steeper might have a higher fiets rating but maybe only at Cat 4 or Cat 5. 

The best thing you can do with fiets is to familiarize yourself with it and what your favorite climbs are rated. From there you'll be able to know what to expect for efforts that correspond to fiets ratings.

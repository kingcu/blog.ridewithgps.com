title: "Comp Wrap Up: Cold-as-Hell Challenge"
---
The Cold-as-Hell challenge proved to be our hardest individual competition to date. The weather was miserable for most, and the distance goals were lofty. However, in spite of the difficulty, the Cold-as-Hell challenge was a huge success. Not only are the sheer numbers of rides, hours, and miles impressive but the pictures that participants shared made this event come to life more than any of the others we have put on. 

The feedback we receive from participants of these challenges is extremely positive.
<blockquote><i>I had entirely too much fun. This was first time ever riding in the snow, thanks to the Cold as Hell Challenge and thanks to Michigan actually having winter this year. I had a heart attack a couple of years ago, so I'm highly committed to having fun staying fit. - Dan Spangler</i></blockquote>

Here's how awesome the participants are

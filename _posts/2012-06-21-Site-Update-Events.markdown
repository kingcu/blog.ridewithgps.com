title: "Site Update: Events!"
---
A feature we have been wanting to develop for awhile is something that give users and groups the abiltiy to create events. We have a lot of event promoters that use our site as well as groups who plan recurring activities or multi-leg rides. So we set out to fill the need and just released our first version of Ride With GPS Events!

There are a few different ways to create your own event. One, if you are the admin of a group you will see the link "Create an event" on your group's profile page:

Once you select that link you'll receive this dialog box:

Fill in your info like so:

And you get this page where you can begin creating/adding routes by clicking the "Add a route" link:

If you already have a route you want to use it will show up in a
dropdown once you click the "Add a route" link.

Once you have added a few routes your event page will start to look like this:

<img class="postimage" src="/images/post_images/events_6.png">

After you have added your routes, you'll probably want to put in some
information about the event. Just click "edit" in the overview tab to
adjust the basic details about the event. For additional content, you
can add custom tabs.  Click the "+" tab and you will get a new tab
that looks like this by default:

<img class="postimage" src="/images/post_images/events_7.png"> 

Clicking edit brings up the simple WYSIWYG editor that lets you do
some basic formatting.  Just replace the sample content, edit the tab
label, and click Save.

You'll also be able to search for Events through the search drop down
menu and if you dont' have a group page you can create an event by
selecting "Create event" on the event search page. 

We are very excited about this release of Events and are looking
forward to our next iteration on this set of features. Please check out an event page in action <a href="">here</a> let us know what you think!

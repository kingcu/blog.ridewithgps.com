title: "Site Update: Events!"

A feature we have been wanting to develop for awhile is something that give users and groups the abiltiy to create events. We have a lot of event promoters that user our site as well as groups who plan re-occuring activities or multiday rides. So we set out to fill the need and just released our first version of Ride With GPS Events!

There are a few different way's that you can create your own event. One, if you are the admin of a group you will see the link "Create an event" on your group's profile page:

<img class="postimage" src="/images/post_images/events_1.png">

Once you select that link you'll receive this dialog box:

<img class="postimage" src="/images/post_images/events_2.png">

Fill in your info like so:

<img class="postimage" src="/images/post_images/events_3.png">

And you get this page where you can begin creating/adding routes by clicking the "Add a route" link: 

<img class="postimage" src="/images/post_images/events_4.png">

If you already have a route you want to use click "Add a route" next to "Stage 1" or you can create a brand new route by clicking the "plan a route" link:

<img class="postimage" src="/images/post_images/events_5.png">

Once you have added a few routes your event page will start to look like this:

<img class="postimage" src="/images/post_images/events_6.png">

Once you have added a your routes you'll probably want to put in some information about our event up, and you can do that in the overview tab here:

<img class="postimage" src="/images/post_images/events_7.png"> 

Want to add some more information? Click the "+" next to "Overview" and "Custom" to add another tab and more content!

You'll also be able to search for Events through the search drop down menu and if you dont' have a group page you can create an event by selecting "Create event" in the search page. 

We are very excited about this release of Events and hope to you do too. Please check out an event page in action <a href="">here</a> let us know what you think!

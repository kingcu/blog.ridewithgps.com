title: "Meet Our Newest/First Employee"

Ride With GPS has been growing rapidly this year, to the point we were able to hire our first employee! So, without further pleasantries we'd like you to meet Travis.

Travis has been an endurance athlete in one way or another for 10 years, and has been a competitive amature cyclist for the last 4. He lives in Boulder, CO and will be doing online and social media marketing, blog management as well as many other tasks. We are very excited about this big step for Ride With GPS. We need all the help we can get and Travis is a perfect fit.

You can get to know Travis by following him on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/travcaldwell">@travcaldwell</a>

title: "About Ride With GPS Video"
---
Recently we had the pleasure of spending the day with Michael Calcagno from <a href="http://calcagnomedia.com/?utm_source=RideWithGPS&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=DailyPost">Calcagno Media</a>. Luckily, the weather cooperated with us for our video shoot, and we were able to spend the day in the Columbia River Gorge. We took great scenery footage for our video and Michael was awesome to work with. 

What we wanted going into this project was a video that did a good job of explaining the bigger picture and full <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/?utm_source=Blog&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=DailyPost">Ride With GPS</a> story. Michael quickly understood the scope of our project and we feel like he produced a video that perfectly fit our need. 

Don't just take our word for it though, watch the video now!

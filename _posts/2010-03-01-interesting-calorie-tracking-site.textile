This isn't directly Ride With GPS related, however I thought this calorie tracking website was a cool idea:

"http://janeme.com":http://janeme.com

We have been thinking about how to best let users track their caloric intake and expenditure and the Jane Me folks have presented a neat model.  It will be cool to see how their service evolves and I wish them well!

title: Your Ride As Art
---

Brian Le Gros of Canada has launched an interesting [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1937465901/your-most-memorable-adventure-displayed-as-persona) for his service, which aims to turn GPS data into physical art.  Using his site [Tracks Edge](http://tracksedge.com) you can take any GPS file, and have it turned into a framed print, or a free standing sculpture.  Check out this great example:

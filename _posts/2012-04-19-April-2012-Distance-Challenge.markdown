We have made it through five days of our distance challenge and we have to admit that this first competition has been extremely fun! Not only is it awesome for us to get to see eveyone out riding, but we are also learning a lot about how to make these competition really cool and fun for everyone. 

We have created a snapshot of the changes to the leaderboard from yesterday. There was lots of movement as some big miles were put it!

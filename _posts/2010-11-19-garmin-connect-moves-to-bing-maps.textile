Garmin Connect just recently moved to Bing based maps, and spurred a huge outcry from their userbase.  The topic on Garmin's forum has racked up a total of twelve pages today alone with many negative comments, including many people talking about how they will be moving on to other sites.  Zack and I just want to say welcome to any Garmin Connect users looking for an innovative, _customer centric_ free website dedicated to being the best way to "log bike rides":http://ridewithgps.com

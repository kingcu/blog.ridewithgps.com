<img style="float:left;" src="/images/post_images/google-plus-hangouts-icon-large.jpg"> Something that we have wanted to impliment for awhile is more direct connection with our members. We've wanted to establish a way to share tips and tricks about Ride With GPS, share and discuss upcoming features, and get feedback from members. 

This last week we tested out our first attempt at this by using Google Plus Hangout Technology. We think that the test run was a huge sucess! Based on how the test run went we have decided to schedule out our first series of hangouts and we are excited to announce the dates and topics below:

August Hangout Series: 

- 8/1/12 5:30pm Pacific Time: Route Creation Tips and Tricks | <a href="">Sign Up</a>
- 8/8/12 5:30pm Pacific Time: Garmin 800 Tips and Tricks | <a href="">Sign Up</a>
- 8/15/12 5:30pm Pacific Time: Route Creation Tips and Tricks | <a href="">Sign Up</a>
- 8/22/12 5:30pm Pacific Time: Groups, Events, and Segments | <a href="">Sign Up</a>

Zack and Travis will be the hosts for the first series. The way the hangouts will work is that the first 8 members to join the hangout when it starts will be able to interact with us through screen-sharing and their mic's. The rest of the people who join will be able to watch the hangout live on youtube and interact through the hangout's chat feature. If you don't use google plus that's okay because you can watch live through youtube!

We are really excited about this series and want to expand in the future, so please let us know if you have a topic you'd like for us to cover or a time frame that would work better for you. We're looking forward to hanging out with you, so don't wait to signup!

Something we have wanted to implement for a while is a more direct
connection with our members. We've wanted to establish a way to share
tips and tricks about Ride With GPS, share and discuss upcoming
features, and get more direct feedback. 

This last week we gave this a shot by hosting a Google Plus
Hangout. With this service, we are able to broadcast our screens and
voices to an unlimited number of people who can watch live via
Youtube. Also, up to 10 people can join the Hangout directly using
their webcam/microphone.  We think that the test run was a huge
success, and we have decided to schedule out our first series of
Hangouts as a result.  Here are the proposed topics and times:

August Hangout Series: 

- 8/1/12 5:30pm Pacific Time: Route Creation Tips and Tricks | <a href="">Sign Up</a>
- 8/8/12 5:30pm Pacific Time: Garmin 800 Tips and Tricks | <a href="">Sign Up</a>
- 8/15/12 5:30pm Pacific Time: Route Creation Tips and Tricks | <a href="">Sign Up</a>
- 8/22/12 5:30pm Pacific Time: Groups, Events, and Segments | <a href="">Sign Up</a>

Zack and Travis will be the hosts for the first series. The way the hangouts will work is that the first 8 members to join the hangout when it starts will be able to interact with us through screen-sharing and their mic's. The rest of the people who join will be able to watch the hangout live on youtube and interact through the hangout's chat feature. If you don't use google plus that's okay because you can watch live through youtube!

We are really excited about this series and want to expand in the future, so please let us know if you have a topic you'd like for us to cover or a time frame that would work better for you. We're looking forward to hanging out with you, so don't wait to signup!

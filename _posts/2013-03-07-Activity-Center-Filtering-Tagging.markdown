We just released some great new additions to the Activity Center, one of our
flagship premium account features that lets you explore and manage all of your
ride/activity data with ease. 

## Advanced Filtering

Now that we've built out our advanced filtering tool, you can explore your data
in new ways. 

Here are some examples of what you can do:

<div style="margin-left: 190px;">
<ul>
<li>Graph the time you spent commuting this year.</li>
<li>See all the times you've climbed 5k feet or more in 2012.</li>
<li>Get a list of all 30-40 mile rides you've ever recorded.</li>
</div>

These queries are so simple now that it's actually fun to explore and organize
years of ride data!

<div style="clear:left;"></div>

## Bulk Tagging

Find the rides you want to group, select them, and add tags. It's fast and
straightforward to get your rides organized exactly how you want.

## Graph what you want 

I wanted a graph of all my commutes in 2010. No problem. Visualizing exactly
what _you_ want to see is so easy you'll actually do it.

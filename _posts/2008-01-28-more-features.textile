Some additions to our work done yesterday, which will greatly improve gear and trip searchability.  You can now decide what type of gear you are entering.  You have two choices: methods of transportation, and accessories.  Transportation types allow us to define what your planned route is good for, as well as to say what you took on a trip.  Now you can search routes for ones that are compatible with your preferred activity.  You can also input accessories such as GPS units, safety gear, running/hiking shoes etc, that can be taken on a trip in addition to your method of transportation.

I want to first say how excited I am to be part of the Ride With GPS team! There is a lot of work to be done, and it's an exciting time to get to be part of Ride With GPS.

My goal is to maintain the same level of quality of work that Cullen and Zack have been able to provide up to now, and in order to do so we are currently outlining how we want to move forward. While we iron out the details, you can expect updates regarding:

-       site features
-       site updates 
-       product highlights

But you can also expect some more light-hearted and cycling-related posts, too.

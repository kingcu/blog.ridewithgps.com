title: "New feature: Segments"
---
We have just released the ability to define segments, which gives you
an easy and fun way of analyzing multiple rides at once and see where
you stand in your area on your favorite roads.  Anyone can create segments and
participate today. Our premium users can use segments privately, and
create segments directly from laps recorded on a GPS unit.

Here is a video demonstrating how to create a segment:

And here is a video walking through all the details of the segment

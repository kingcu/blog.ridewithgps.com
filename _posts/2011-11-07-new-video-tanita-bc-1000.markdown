We now support syncing with weight/body composition data, and
displaying it in the Activity Center. You can get this data with a
Tanita BC-1000 Body Composition Monitor, which is a scale that will do
a wireless sync with a handful of Garmin GPS units, as well as an Ant+
USB stick plugged into your computer.

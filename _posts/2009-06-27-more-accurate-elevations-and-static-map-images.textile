title: More Accurate Elevations AND Static Map Images

Over the last two weeks, I have been hard at work doing two things: making elevations more accurate, as well as providing static map images that can be embedded into forums.  After some hard work, I am pleased to say that both goals have been accomplished!  There were multiple reasons for inaccurate gain/loss figures for both uploaded and mapped rides.  A more detailed description of the problem and solution can be found at "http://cullenking.com":http://cullenking.com and I will let you read that separately, since it involves a decent amount of math :)

Static map images are now available for any route or trip on the site.  There are currently two default sizes: a 100x100 pixel thumbnail, as well as a 480x480 pixel image.  They are stored as GIF's, and can be accessed by navigating to any route/trip view page and copy/pasting the link that is provided to the right of the map.  The map tiles are provided by the "openstreetmap":http://openstreetmap.org project, which is basically the wikipedia of the mapping world.  We are sketching out plans for custom map image sizes, but will likely reserve that feature for premium accounts.

Here is an example of a nice trip in Lake Oswego:

A more detailed post will follow when I have a spare moment.  Just wanted to get the word out for now!

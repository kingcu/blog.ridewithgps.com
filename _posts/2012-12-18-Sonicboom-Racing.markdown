<img src="/images/post_images/SonicBoom_Logo_2010_vert.jpg" style="float:right;" height="200">We are very excited to be sponsoring our first cycling team, Sonic Boom Racing p/b Lucky Pie Pizza & Taphouse. SBR is a community cycling team focused on developing Colorado riders. SBR team members range from competitive riders at the junior level to riders at the National Racing Calendar pro level, and has a place for riders at every stage of racing. SBR is committed to racing clean, promoting the sport of cycling, and mentoring young, talented cyclist.

This sponsorship is a great opportunity for us, and we believe that it will help both sides grow. It will be a unique opportunity for us to work closely with a group of competitive cyclists who can test the site features in ways they really haven't been tested before. This will help us create more functional and appealing features for groups, clubs, teams, and events.

When asked about the sponsorship, Colby Ricker (Cat 1 SBR Rider) had this to say: "I'm really excited to have a forum to plan, review, and share the progress that we're making both as individual racers and a team."

We are excited to see how the 2013 season goes for the Sonic Boom Racing team riders.

title: "Site Update: Segments v.1.5"
---
After our first iteration of our Segment feature we've been busy behind the scenes listening to feedback and trying to figure how to improve on the feature to make it better. The major feedback that we received, past the feature being cool, was that it wasn't intuitive enough and that it was prominent on the site. In attempt to enhance the Segment features with this feedback we've released Segments v.1.5 which is an intermedary release as we will be releasing v.2 shortly, but significant enough that we didn't want to wait any longer. Below is an outline of the changes you'll see.


Search: We've added the ability to search for Segments from the Search drop down menu. This search works just like the ride, and rider searches do. This has proven to be very usefully right away.

New Segment Tab: We have added a new tab on the left hand side of the screen. All Segments associated on your trip will now be displayed here as well as all best effort data.

Creating a Segment: You can now create a Segment from any selection you have zoomed from the ride. Once you have a selection that you want to create as a Segment you can click the "select Segment" from the bottom of the elevation profile.

Next you are given the opportunity to "Zoom out", "Re-center", "Save", or "Cancel".

Once you have fine tuned your selection and you're ready to save you'll be give the option to either save the selection as a Segment or simply save an anotation for the selection.

If you decide to save the selection as a Segment you'll be given the opportunity to Name the Segment as well as to set it as either "Public" or "Private".

To make the Segment "Private" or "Public", simply select the option you prefer from the drop down menu, and then click save.

We will be releasing more features soon, but in the meantime happy segmenting!

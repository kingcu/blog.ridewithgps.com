title: "Site Update: Segment Revisions Pre-release"
---
After our first iteration of our Segments feature we've been busy
behind the scenes listening to feedback and planning our next set of improvements. The major feedback that we
received, beyond the feature being cool, was that it wasn't intuitive
enough or prominent enough  on the site. We have been working on our
Segment Revisions project, which has the internal name of "Segments
Everywhere".  This project will bring segments to users, groups, and
events. While working on this project, we have already completed a bunch of great changes, though, and decided to
do this pre-release.  The final update to segments will be coming
shortly! Below is an outline of the changes that have already been deployed.


Search: We've added the ability to search for Segments from the Search drop down menu. This search works just like the ride, and rider searches do. This has proven to be very useful right away.

New Segment Tab: We have added a new tab on the left hand side of the
screen. All Segments associated on your trip will now be displayed
here as well as laps, splits, best efforts, and annotations.

Creating a Segment: You can now create a Segment from any selection
you have zoomed from the ride. After zooming in on the elevation
profile, click "select segment" in the bottom right below the graph.

Next you are given the opportunity to "Zoom out", "Re-center", "Save", or "Cancel".

Once you have fine tuned your selection and you're ready to save
you'll be give the option to either save the selection as a Segment or
a simple annotation.

If you decide to save the selection as a Segment premium users will
have a new option: now you can save a private segment that only
matches against your rides!

To make the Segment "Public" or "Individual", simply select the option you prefer from the drop down menu, and then click save.

We will be releasing more features soon, but in the meantime happy segmenting!

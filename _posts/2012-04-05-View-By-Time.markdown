title: "Activity Center View Log by Time"
---

No matter what type of cyclist you are, whether you're a competitive racer, or recreational rider you probably do a fair amount of your riding based on time spent on the bike. In order to acknowledge the need to view your activity based on time in the Premium User's Activity Center we added the ability to view the Activity Center graph by Time. You now have three total views for this main graph: Distance, Elevation Gain, and Time.

We really think that this adds a nice level of training analysis to the Activity Center for our premium users.

title: "Activity Center View Log by Time"
---

No matter what type of cyclist you are, a competitive racer or recreational rider, you probably gauge your training using time spent on bike rather than distance. In order to accomodate the need to view activity based on time, we added the ability to view the Activity Center graphs by time. You now have three x-axis to choose from: Distance, Elevation Gain, and Time.

We really think that this adds a nice level of training analysis to the Activity Center.

## Motorcycle-USA integration launched!

We worked with [Motorcycle USA](http://www.motorcycle-usa.com) a while back to develop an integration so their users could search for and check out routes within their site. They recently launched it, check it out if you're interested: [Motorcycle Ride Guide](http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/Motorcycle-Ride-Guide.aspx)

## New route planner and viewer

Currently we are working on a Javascript-based route planner and viewer.  This means that there will no longer be anything in the way of our tools working on iPhones and iPads.  The most significant impact will be that route editing will work great! This is the most important consideration in launching this work, because currently route editing is limited to fairly simple modifications. We want our route planning and viewing tools to be rock solid, bug free, and easy for us to extend and maintain.  That is the goal with this work, and we are currently ahead of schedule and very happy with where this is going. Expect a new route planner and viewer before April. 

Don't worry -- you will not have to learn something new.  We believe that much of what we have done we have done right: elevation live updating and right there for you to see and interact with, easy and fast click-to-draw routes, and an interface that gets uses your browser window space as effectively as possible.  The main impact you will see from this work once it is released are some performance improvements and added features, such as adding photos to your cuesheet entries and points of interest.

## Beta continues with addition of Activity Center 

Our beta is continuing and currently includes the printing of custom maps and cue sheets, and that recent addition of the Activity Center.  We are going to be improving these features and working out the bugs as quickly as we can in order to get them out on our site for everyone to use.  

## Final thoughts

We have been working incredibly hard and will continue to do so... now at an accelerated pace.  Please let us know if you have any concerns or questions.  I wrote this quick post up because someone just reminded me that our blog has not been updated in a while -- any feedback is appreciated and does have an impact!

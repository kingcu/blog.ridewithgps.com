title: "Hot Summer Nights: An Challenge Based on Ride Time!"
---
<img style="float:left;" src="/images/post_images/hourevent_graphic.png"> We are smack dab in the middle of summer and we want to celebrate! So we've decided to base our next Ride With GPS competition off of hours logged on the bike. 

<a href="">Sign Up Here</a> for Hot Summer Nights!

Like the Tour de France, we will be offering three levels of difficulty, so that people can challenge themselves appropriately. The first level will be geared towards people who spend less time on the bike, and the other two will challenge more serious cyclists. 

Event Details:

*Who: You!<br />
What: 15 hrs, 30hrs, 60hrs
<br />
When: August 4th through August 26th
<br />
Where: Everywhere
<br />
Why: To take advantage of the long hot days!*

We will be awarding prizes to top-place finishers. We'll also award prizes for the competition's more noteworthy rides. As has been the case with the previous competitions this should be a lot of fun and we hope you'll all participate!

Looks like we finally received some cool weather here in Eugene, which made for a nice day of coding.  Here are some of the updates:
                  <br />

                  <ul>
                    
                    
                    <li>You can specify what routes are for (riding a motorcycle, mountain biking, hiking, running, cycling, etc).  Edit your routes and check off what they are for! This will help people find them.</li>
                    
                    <li>No more horizontal scrollbar for most users that were experiencing this.</li>
                    
                    <li>Improved efficiency (which translates to faster browsing) throughout the site.</li>
                    
                    <li>Added a search by zip code with distance threshold on browse routes page.</li>
                </ul>

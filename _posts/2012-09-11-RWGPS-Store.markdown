Over the last few years we've recevied countless requests for Ride With GPS branded merchandise. While we have wanted to provide this for awhile it has taken us some time to get to a point where we could. With our efforts of expanding this year we have been able, finally, to start offering some Ride With GPS products. 

You can see all of the products we are offering on the Products page. But, we wanted to take a few minutes and give a bit more background information on each product.

All of our cycling apparel is currently being manufactured by <a href="http://castelli-cycling.com/en/home/">Castelli</a>. We choose to go with Castelli in particular because we have personal experience with their product and feel like that experience allows us to ensure that our Ride With GPS products are of the highest quality and will last for a long long time. Additionally, we like the fact that Castelli is based out of the Pacific Northwest and that their products are manufactured in the USA. We would like to offer some cycling appareal at a cheaper rate, but ultimately felt like we didn't want to sacrafice quality for cost. Also, Castelli's printing is top notch!

Our cycling apparel has been designed by <a href="http://www.beercitizen.com/citizens/Ryan">Ryan Wilcoxson</a>. Ryan is a good friend of ours from Southern Oregon and is an avid cyclist and a strong cat 2 bike racer! Ryan's full time gig is as a video and graphic designer for <a href="http://www.definitionstudio.com/">Definition LLC</a> which is a small firm based out of San Francisco and his recent work includes a new community beer review site, <a href="http://www.beercitizen.com/">Beer Citizen</a>. If you enjoy a good cold beer then you should checkout the site! Ryan has also designed kits for: <a href="hhttp://sc-velo.com/2011/12/13/service-course-velo-kit-re-order/">Service Course Velo</a> and Sappo Hill Cycling Team shown below.

We are working with Ryan to get bibs and other cycling apparel items designed and available as soon as possible.

**<a href="http://ridewithgps.com/products/RWGPS-T-Shirt">T Shirts</a> | $15.00**

Our t shirts are made by American Apparel and printed by <a href="http://www.inkbrigade.com/">Inkbrigade</a>. We chose these two option because Inkbrigade is a local Portland, Oregon company and American Apparel shirts are made in the USA. Both options seemed like a good fit! (get it?)

The design of the t shirts was a colaborative effort by the three of us, and we just got lucky!

**<a href="http://ridewithgps.com/products/RWGPS-Purist-Water-Bottle">Water Bottles</a> | $8.00 &amp; $11.00**

For water bottles we set out looking for a bottle that offered two things: 1) no taste and 2) durable drinking spout. From our testing and experience the best option proved itself to be the <a href="http://specializedwaterbottles.com/purist/">Specialized Purist</a>. These are awesome new bottles that Specialized is making! They are a non leaching, clean tasting, and flexible bottle with an awesome drinking spout. Plus, Specialized does an awesome job of the printing. We didn't feel that there was a higher quality bottle we could find for a better price.

We are offering the bottles in two sizes:

- <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/products/RWGPS-Purist-Water-Bottle">22oz Water Bottle</a>
- <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/products/26oz-Purist-Water-Bottle">26oz Water Bottle</a>

The design for the bottles, like the shirts, was colaborative effort by the three of us and again, we got lucky on the designing front!

**<a href="http://ridewithgps.com/products/OSM-Maps-for-Garmin-GPS-Units">OSM Maps</a> | $20.00**  

Our OSM Maps offer blah blah blah blah

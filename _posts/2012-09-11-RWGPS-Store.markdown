store</a>

Over the last few years we've received countless requests for Ride With GPS branded merchandise. While we have wanted to provide this for awhile it has taken us some time to get to a point where we could. With our efforts of expanding this year we have been able, finally, to start offering some Ride With GPS products. 

You can see all of the products we are offering on the Products page. But, we wanted to take a few minutes and give a bit more background information on each product.

All of our cycling apparel is currently being manufactured by <a href="http://castelli-cycling.com/en/home/">Castelli</a>. We choose to go with Castelli in particular because we have personal experience with their products and feel like that experience allows us to ensure that our Ride With GPS products are of the highest quality and will last for a long long time. Additionally, we like the fact that Castelli is based out of the Pacific Northwest and that their products are manufactured in the USA. We would like to offer some cycling appareal at a cheaper rate, but ultimately felt like we didn't want to sacrifice quality for cost. Also, Castelli's printing is top notch!

Our cycling apparel has been designed by <a href="http://www.beercitizen.com/citizens/Ryan">Ryan Wilcoxson</a>. Ryan is a good friend of ours from Southern Oregon and is an avid cyclist and a strong cat 2 bike racer! Ryan's full time gig is as a video and graphic designer for <a href="http://www.definitionstudio.com/">Definition LLC</a> which is a small firm based out of San Francisco and his recent work includes a new community beer review site, <a href="http://www.beercitizen.com/">Beer Citizen</a>. If you enjoy a good cold beer then you should checkout the site! Ryan has also designed kits for <a href="hhttp://sc-velo.com/2011/12/13/service-course-velo-kit-re-order/">Service Course Velo</a> and Sappo Hill Cycling Team, shown below.

We are working with Ryan to get bibs and other cycling apparel items designed and available as soon as possible.

**<a href="http://ridewithgps.com/products/RWGPS-T-Shirt">T Shirts</a> | $15.00**

Our t shirts are made by American Apparel and printed by <a href="http://www.inkbrigade.com/">Inkbrigade</a>. We chose these two vendors because Inkbrigade is a local Portland, Oregon company and American Apparel shirts are made in the USA. Both options seemed like a good fit! (get it?)

The design of the t-shirts was a collaborative effort by the three of
us. We're really happy with how these came out now that they are printed!

**<a
  href="http://ridewithgps.com/products/RWGPS-Purist-Water-Bottle">Water
  Bottles</a> | $10.00 &amp; $13.00 (at the time of this post, on sale
  for $8 &amp; $11)** 

For water bottles we set out looking for a bottle that offered two
things: 1) no taste and 2) durable drinking spout. From our testing
and experience the best option proved itself to be the <a
href="http://specializedwaterbottles.com/purist/">Specialized
Purist</a>. These new bottles made by Specialized are the best bottles
we have ever used! They are a non-leaching, clean tasting, and
flexible bottle with an awesome drinking spout. Plus, Specialized does
a great job with the printing. We didn't feel that there was a higher
quality bottle we could find, and by putting in a large order we're
able to offer them at a great price.

We are offering the bottles in two sizes:

- <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/products/RWGPS-Purist-Water-Bottle">22oz Water Bottle</a>
- <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/products/26oz-Purist-Water-Bottle">26oz Water Bottle</a>

The design for the bottles, like the shirts, was a collaborative
effort by the three of us and again, we got lucky on the designing
front as they turned out great!

**<a
  href="http://ridewithgps.com/products/OSM-Maps-for-Garmin-GPS-Units">OSM
  Maps for Garmin GPS Units</a> | $20.00**  

On our help pages for the <a
href="http://ridewithgps.com/edge_705">Garmin Edge 705</a> and the <a
href="http://ridewithgps.com/edge_800">Garmin Edge 800</a> we have
been recommending the use of OSM Maps (<a
href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>) as a
substitute for the Garmin City Navigator maps that come bundled with
those units if you pay a bit extra.  Many people don't purchase the
bundled version of their GPS unit, and end up without any basemaps.
This is too bad because then they can't look at a map, their unit
is unable to do any turn-by-turn routing, and they're left with a GPS
unit that really isn't living up to its potential. The OSM maps are
great in most areas, and you can get them on your unit for free.

The problem is that it can be a bit of a technical challenge to
download the right maps, get the right kind of SD card, and load the
maps onto the SD card in the right way. We are still happy to help
people do this themselves, but are now offering to do the work for you:
we'll preload a card with the maps you need, and all you have to do
is insert it into your Garmin GPS unit.

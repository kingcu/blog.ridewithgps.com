title: "What they don't tell you when you decide to become a bike racer"
---
When you watch a bike race, someone wins. Someone always wins! And the fact of the matter is that when someone decides to get into bike racing they have this preconceived notion that they can win bike races because they've watched them and think, "I can do that!" It's true; some people can do that. However, the majority of people who race bikes have never won a race and probably never will. They've come to terms with that, and still go out to the battle field because it's what they love to do, and, well, there's still a chance they could win!

There are a lot of things about bike racing people don't tell you when you decide to get into bike racing. One of the things they don't tell you is the fact that you'll finish dead last more times than you will win. Which is to say, you will do well to ever win a race. Finishing off the back, in the groupetto, or DFL is part of bike racing. A very real part of bike racing. It's something you have to either learn how to cope with, handle, or embrace, or you won't be a good bike racer.

I think this is the exact reason why no one tells you that you'll finish off the back more times than you'll win. Because for them it's so much a part of the process and experience that it never even occurs to them that you might even for the slightest second think that you're going to go out and ride everyone off your wheel and win every race. Instead, they are excited to have someone else to race and ride with, so they encourage and let the bike racing do the humbling.

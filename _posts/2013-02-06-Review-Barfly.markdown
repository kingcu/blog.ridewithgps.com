The Garmin mount system has historically sucked. I didn't like it for the 305 or the 705 when they were a zip-tie system, and I liked it even less when they switched to the pseudo rubber-band system with the 500 and 800. I have seen more than one rider lose their computer hitting a bump during a race. Not cool! Due to my frustration with the standard Garmin mounts, I was excited to get my hands on a <a href="http://www.tatelabs.com/">Bar Fly mount from Tate Labs</a>. 

Pros:

- Better position for viewing the display: This is one of those situations where you don't realize how bad something was until it changes. The Bar Fly puts your computer in a much more natural viewing space than when it's on your stem. Also, since you can adjust the angle of the Bar Fly you can make sure that you have the right viewing angle for your riding position. This is not possible when the unit is mounted to your stem.
- More Secure Mount: The bolt on Bar Fly isn't going anywhere. The mount, once attached is solidly in place. I like the fact that as I ride over rough terrain the mount doesn't deviate from it's desired position. This is a big improvement from the standard Garmin mount.
- More Secure GPS Bracket: The first time I attached my Garmin 800 to the Bar Fly I wasn't actually sure that the Garmin was going to fit it was so tight. Now after a couple months of heavy use, the connection between the two still feels as solid as it did on day one. I have gained a lot of confidence in the Bar Fly, and I trust that my Garmin isn't going to fall off my bike. 

Cons:

- Material: The polycarbonate material does not feel as strong as I would like.
- Cost: $40.00 is a challenging justification for a piece of 'plastic'.

Final Thoughts
<br>
I received my Bar Fly as a Birthday present. Before using it I could not justify the additional $40 purchase. Now that I have been using it for a couple months I really can't imagine not having it. I think that the added security it provides outweighs the cost. Lets face it, if I lose my Garmin it's going to cost me more than $40 to replace it. There are a few more options similar to the Bar Fly that are out on the market now, and that is helping the cost come down to a more reasonable price. As of this writing, you can get a <a href="http://www.competitivecyclist.com/za/CCY?PAGE=BUY_PRODUCT_STANDARD&PRODUCT.ID=11582&MODE=">Bar Fly on Competitive Cyclist</a> on sale for $25.

Lastly, this is a great gift idea!

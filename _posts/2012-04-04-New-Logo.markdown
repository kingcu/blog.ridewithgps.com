title: "New Logo"

Along with updating our color scheme we also felt like it was time for our logo to grow up and reflect our core cycling market. Since we do not claim to be graphic designers and we think the concept of crowd sourcing is cool, we opted to try out <a href="http://99designs.com/">99designs</a>. Setting up the initial competition with some clear objectives was the easy part.  Picking from the 110 total designs proved to be much more difficult.

At first it was easy to pick the good from the bad. But, as the competition went into the late rounds it became really hard to pick between the designs. However, we pushed through the tough times and picked the winner!

We are really happy about and excited for our new logo. We feel like it's really helping make the site feel more professional. We hope you like it too!

The desinger who produced the winning logo was Corne. If you'd like to see more of Corne's work you can see the full <a href="http://99designs.com/users/438160">99desings profile here</a>. Corne was really easy to work with and was always able to make changes quickly and correctly and we really enjoyed to colaborative process.

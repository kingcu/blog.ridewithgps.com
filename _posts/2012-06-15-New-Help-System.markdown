title: "Site Update: New Help System"
---
One of the most praised aspects of our site is how responsive we are to user questions, suggestions and help requests.  Additionally, our site has been growing at a very rapid pace.  The consequence of this growth has been a gradual slowing of our support responses, and increasingly, less time to actually get stuff done.  Once we took a step back and looked at our existing help system, the problem became apparent - our self-help tools were terrible.  With this in mind we set out to build a comprehensive help page.

We have been keeping track of support emails and phone calls for the
last few months, which enabled us to start the help page with
content from those questions and answers. Over the coming weeks we
will be fleshing out the help content with the goal of comprehensive coverage of site functionality.

In order to make it easy for you to find the answers you are looking for, we updated the "Feedback" process.  Now, when clicking "help/feedback" you'll see this:

The big improvement over our existing form is the in-line search.

This new system should allow you to easily answer your own questions.  If your question is not covered by one of our help topics, you can always submit the question using the above mentioned form.  We strive to answer your questions within 2-3 days.

If you have any questions about "{{ page.title }}" email us at <a href="mailto:info@ridewithgps.com">info@ridewithgps.com</a>

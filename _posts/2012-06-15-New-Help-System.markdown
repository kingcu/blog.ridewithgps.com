title: "Site Update: New Help System"
---
An aspect of the site that we have been spending a lot of time on lately is our help system. Something that we really like about Ride With GPS is how personal it is. Our members can always contact us directly and we do our best to get back to everyone as quickly as possible. 

However, one of the things we have noticed for awhile is that we are spending a lot of time each day or week answering the same or very similar questions. What this told us is that we hadn't done a good job making answers available to our members on the site. And, as hard as we try to make our tool simple and easy to use there are always questions, so we wanted to provide those more readily on the site. 

With this in mind we set out to build our first Help page!

We have been keeping track of support emails and phone calls for the
last few months so we were able to start building the help page with
content from those questions and answers. Over the coming weeks we
will be fleshing out the help content with the goal of it covering the
site functionality comprehensively.

In order to make it really easy for users to find the answers they are looking for we also updated the "Feedback" process, so now when you click "help/feedback" you'll get this:

This screen gives you the option to search the help content, click the "Browse all Help" button and you can go to the help page, click the "Report a Bug" to notify us of a bug, click "Request a Feature" to let us know of a feature you'd like us to work on, or if none of these options answer your question or need you can still send us a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

This new system should allow for our members to have the information they need to use Ride With GPS at their finger tips, but it should also allow us to better respond to issues and questions in a timely manner. 

If you have any questions about "{{ page.title }}" email us at <a href="mailto:info@ridewithgps.com">info@ridewithgps.com</a>

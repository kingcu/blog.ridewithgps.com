title: "Winter Bike Commuting"
---
The date is February 27th which means: I'm cold! The chill comes on every winter at some point in late February, and once it happens I can never seem to shake it. Here's how the story goes:

There are three stages of winter and they break down like this:

- Early Winter: November and December
- Mid Winter: January
- Late Winter: February and March

Winter starts and life is easy during this timeframe I call "Early Winter." The cold mornings and chilly evenings are met with eager anticipation after a long hot summer. The leg-warmers, arm-warmers, vest, wind jacket, long sleeve jersey, thermal jacket are all dug out of the closet and stand ready for whatever mother nature decides to throw at me. However, the temperature doesn't really affect me much. In November and December I can be fine for my commute in approximately 30 degrees with leg-warmers, arm-warmers, a vest, and a cap. 

Mid winter sneaks up and life begins to change. One of the more notable changes is the wardrobe, and in particular, the fact that items are added to it. The wool socks, neck gator, shoe covers, and lobster gloves now make their way into the rotation as do the thermal tights. Also at this point of the season, preparation time for commuting, or riding outside at all, starts to take longer and longer to the point where sometimes I think I spend more time getting dressed and undressed than I do riding.

Late winter might best be described as having a splinter that is so deep you can't remove it. There's a moment, when on a ride the wind will cut through my layers and chill me to the bone. From this point on logic and reason are dismissed from the wardrobe selection process and instead I just wear every piece of warm clothing I own, because, well, it's cold and dark out. At this point, the temperature that in "Early Winter" didn't even warrant a long sleeve jersey now deserves a thermal jacket and tights.

Usually in late winter I can also feel the drain of the winter bike commute mentally as my decision making on and off the bike diminish. Just last week I was riding to the office on a cold morning after a snow storm, and instead of riding the snow bike (the obvious bike to ride) I convinced myself that the road bike was adequate for the conditions. I made it out the snow covered driveway, and down the snow packed alley to the ice skating rink that is called "the street" and within 100ft I was reminded of why I wear a helmet. *Special note: there's nothing like sliding down an icy street on your backside to start your day off right!*

I wouldn't trade or stop bike commuting for anything, so luckily there is a positive aspect of the "Late Winter Chill" and that is, it means SPRING is right around the corner. Soon the afternoons will be filled with warm rides that wont require leg-warmers, arm-warmers, caps, or any other similar layers. The moral of the story is, don't let old man winter get you down!

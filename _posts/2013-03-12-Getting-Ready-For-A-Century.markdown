title: "Getting Ready For A Century"
---
Day light savings is here, the days are getting longer, and the rides are starting to stretch out. With spring rapidly approaching we are creeping close to event season. A fair of amount of you will be doing some sort of cycling event this summer, so we reached out to our friend Thom Kneeland again, and asked him for his advice on preparing for a century. Here's his top 8 tips on making certain you and your bike are ready for the challenge..

<blockquote>
8. Choose the century wisely. You’re going to want to check out the route to make certain you’re up for the task at hand. A 100 miles through the heart of the Rocky Mountains is certainly majestic, but if you are a flatlander, you might not be prepared for the amount of climbing that there will be. A pan flat century has it’s own difficulties. You are going to be pedaling the entire time. The flip side to climbing hill is that at some point you get to come down them and that means coasting. Not much coasting when the biggest elevation gain and loss is a freeway overpass. Plus, flat rides are often affected by winds and if you have to do the last 50 miles of a century into a headwind, it’s like climbing the invisible hill that never ends.

7. Use your computer for something other than FaceBook and Twitter and do a little research on how well the ride is supported. You want lots of rest stops well stocked with all sorts of goodies treats. Is the course well marked? What’s the after ride meal like? These are all things that will have a very memorable impact on your century.

6. Know the route as best as you can. Most rides provide maps, corner markings, and people to assist you at all the aid stations. Knowing your route is key. Not much will shut a rider down like thinking you just have to be almost done and then finding out there’s still one more climb and 25 miles to go. If you have the elevation profile, you won’t get tricked on climbs by the false summits. Also, you can always figure out a shortcut if needed. No one is getting a pro contract because the suffered through a century and if shaving off 12 miles keeps your spouse from mutinying during the ride, then that’s a smart time to pack it in early.

5. Training is good. You should do some. Ride enough so that after you do the century, you don’t throw your bike into the garage and leave it there for a month or until the idea of sitting on a bike seat no longer fills you with dread. You can get very specific in your training and hire coaches and download workouts, but a good rule of thumb is that you should be able to do some rides that are at least twice as long in duration than your regular rides and be okay afterwards. If your body falls apart during a 3 hour ride, it will fail during the century.

4. Wear good clothes. There’s a reason that some bike shorts cost as much as they do. You get what you pay for in chamois quality. Your undercarriage is worth the investment.  Use a chamois creme. They work very well at keeping anything important from getting chafed. You’re gonna sweat and that sweat dries out leaving a nice, salty, abrasive that does wonders at irritating, so do what you should never do at a car dealer and pay for the undercoating. Oh BTW, don’t wear underwear under your shorts. It’s like hiking with a wrinkle in you socks, except if you think a blister is bad on your heel, wait until you get one down there. Not good. Trust me.

3. Make certain your bike is working and safe to ride. Don’t try and squeeze one more ride out of some worn out tires. New ones will ride smoother and easier, plus if you have a blowout and crash taking someone with you, you’re gonna ruin someone else’s day. Remember that you aren’t out there by yourself.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
2. A common refrain of mechanical advice is to never do anything to your bike right before you do a big or important ride. This holds true for many things, like I would never recommend a new seat the night before or a different shoe/cleat set up. However, bikes aren’t mystery machines ruled by witchcraft and voodoo, so if your bike isn’t shifting right on your after work rides, by all means get it down to your local shop and let them fix it. Pros who make their living racing bikes get recently worked on steeds all the time. Do you think they go into the Tour de France with a bike that hasn’t been lubed in 3 months and hope for the best? No. What’s most important is you have a bike that functions like it should, meaning it shifts smoothly through all the available gears, brakes are adjusted with plenty of brake pad material, handlebar tape is intact and not sloughing off, cables are smooth and unfrayed, tires are round, in good shape with no cuts, and plenty of rubber, and your wheels are true and tensioned. If your bike needs fixing, fix it and fix it properly. You’re going to be doing a ride with a few hundred other people and you’re going to have to sign a waiver stating that you and your bike are ready to go, so you have a responsibility to see that you are.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
1. Most importantly when it comes to doing a century, is go into it with clear intentions of what you want to get out of it. If you just want to ride a hundred miles to see if you can, don’t have expectations of sitting in a fast group and trading pulls all day. Conversely, if you need to crack the 5 hour time, don’t go the the century with friends who are looking for an all day social ride. And always know when to call it a day if there’s an early out option.

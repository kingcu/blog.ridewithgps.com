You can now connect with people on <a href="http://ridewithgps.com">Ride With GPS</a> through our new Groups features. Groups will allow you to easily meet, coordinate, share, and compare rides, routes, and events with other group members. You can easily search for groups in your area or afar. Or, you can create your own Ride With GPS Group!

To get started find the group you're looking for by selecting "Group" from the "Search" drop down menu, or <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/groups">click here to go to groups</a>.

Next select the group you're wanting to join from the results:

Once you're on the Groups page you can join and check out what the group is up to:

Now that you are a member of the group it will display on your profile right below your photo:

Additionally, Group admins and members have the ability to:
- Associate Routes
- Easily Share Group
- Coordinate Routes From One Spot
- Upload Group Photos

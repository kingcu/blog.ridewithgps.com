title: Route Planner Updates: Out-and-back, reverse, undo/redo, more!"
---
The route mapping tool is the cornerstone of the site and we are continually working to enhance it. Recently we released several new features for the route mapping tool, also we were able to fix a couple outstanding issues. Below are details:

**New feature: Out-and-back**

The Out-and-back feature regenerates comands based on the paramaters you set initally.  for the directions one control point at a time, back to the start.

**Comprehensive undo/redo support.**

Now you can undo your drag/drop operations! This works with cuesheet entries, POI, control points, drag/drop operations... everything!


**Additional Highlights**
	
Ability to add to cuesheet, and add control points, by clicking the elevation profile. If you need to add a custom cue or drag/edit an out-and-back route, it is now possible (we have further improvements planned, but this is a good stopgap for now).
Drag/drop editing for OSM/RWGPS/OSMCycle maps fixed. 
Copied routes default to "private" now. That means they don't clutter search results any more! 
POI don't disappear anymore when you reload the route planner to restore an auto-saved route.

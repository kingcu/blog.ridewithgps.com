See the Activity Widget in action on the <a href="http://www.sonicboomracing.com/?utm_source=Blog&utm_medium=WidgetPost&utm_campaign=WidgetPost">Sonicboom Racing website</a>.

We think that this feature will prove to be valuable for use on personal websites and blogs, team and clubs websites, as well as for coaches on their websites.

Additionally, the work that we have put into this feature has allowed us to turn our attention to our map embed features, and we will be looking to update those embeds very soon. Hint: multiple route embed for personal, groups, and event accounts.

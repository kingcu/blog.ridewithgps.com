---
We are proud to release an all new Ride With GPS feature, the <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/widgets/new?utm_source=Blog&utm_medium=WidgetPost&utm_campaign=WidgetPost">Activity Widget</a>! Members can now embed this widget in their own site to display a list of their recent activities for either their personal account, or a group they are a part of. Optionally, the widget can also include weekly, monthly, and year to date totals. The Activity Widget is customizable with multiple options for how much data can be displayed.

See the Activity Widget in action on the <a href="http://www.sonicboomracing.com/?utm_source=Blog&utm_medium=WidgetPost&utm_campaign=WidgetPost">Sonicboom Racing website</a>.

We think that this feature will prove to be valuable for use on personal websites and blogs, team and clubs websites, as well as for coaches on their websites.

Additionally, the work that we have put into this feature has allowed us to turn our attention to our map embed features, and we will be looking to update those embeds very soon. Hint: multiple route embed for personal, group, and event accounts.

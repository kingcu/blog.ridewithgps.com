that Ride with GPS will be the official route planning software for the <a href="http://tour.diabetes.org/">Tour de Cure</a>!

The Tour de Cure is one of the largest cycling events in the United
States and stages charity rides across the country to
raise money for the American Diabetes Association. In 2011, more than
55,000 cyclists in 80 events raised over $18 million to support the
mission of the ADA: to prevent and cure diabetes and to improve the
lives of all people affected by diabetes.

It is a huge honor for us to be the new mapping system for these
events and to be associated with this wonderful charity. Our goal is
to help provide the best route maps so that each event can maximize
its ability to promote and raise money for the American Diabetes
Association. 

Events will play a significant role in the future of Ride with GPS.
If you want to talk to us about your event, please get in touch!

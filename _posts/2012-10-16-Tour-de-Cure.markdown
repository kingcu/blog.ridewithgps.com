<img src="/images/post_images/2012-tdc-logo.gif" align="right" valign="top" style="margin-left:10px">We are very excited to announce that we have recently established a relationship with the <a href="http://tour.diabetes.org/site/PageServer?pagename=TC_homepage">American Diabetes Association Tour de Cure</a> organization. 

The Tour de Cure is the second largest cycling event in the United States and stages charity rides across the country in an effort to raise money for the American Diabetes Association. Last year the Tour de Cure held 86 events in 44 states and raised over $21 million for the American Diabetes Association as over 60,000 cyclist participated in each event. 

This is very exciting for us because in this new relationship all of the 86 events that the Tour de Cure stages will utilize Ride With GPS for the route creation for all routes! It is a huge honor for us to be the new mapping system for these events and to be a part of this wonderful charity. Our goal is to help provide the best route maps for the events so that each event can maximize it's ability to promote and raise money for the American Diabetes Association.

title: "To wear or not to wear"
---
In the ancient days of lore there were no shields to defend soldiers in battle. Then one day, a brilliant man or women realized that they could block an incoming blow if they carried around a piece or a couple pieces of wood. The shield was born. Throughout centuries the shield was perfected and many lives were saved. In bike racing, the riders are soldiers and the helmet is their shield. It was basic at best initially, but has been perfected over time.

I'm fairly use to seeing bike commuters or general public cruising around without a helmet on. But, before I moved to Colorado in 2011 I had not experienced cyclist not wearing them. However, once I moved to Colorado that all changed. I was shocked to see so many cyclist riding with naked heads. It has really made me think a lot about why people wear and don't wear them. 

Back in the old days of bike racing racers didn't wear helmets. But since there creation they have been improved and perfected ever since. Which brings me to my main point. I don't understand why at this point anyone wouldn't wear a helmet. The main argument I've heard against them is weight. Well, they are so ridiculously light now, that argument just doesn't hold water. Another argument I've heard is that "I'm just not use to wearing one" which doesn't seem to me a very solid argument either. 

I don't really fault or have issue with someone not wearing one when they ride by themselves. However, if someone showed up to a group or team ride that I was leading I would not let them participate without one. It's not safe nor is it fair to anyone else on the ride because if something happens to that person then they all have to deal with it. 

The big question I keep coming back to is, why wouldn't you wear a helmet? An explanation that makes sense to me is bravado. You just think your to cool. However, we live in a society where we all have the freedom to make our own decisions, and each person can decide for themselves if wearing a helmet is what they want to do. 

Yes, it's true they may not save your life, but it dramatically increases your chances of surviving the majority of crashes. I've crashed at 40+ mph in a group of 50+ riders and I can tell you one emphatic take away I have from that experience, I will never ride my bike without my helmet. And every time I see someone riding along without one I will always ask myself, why?

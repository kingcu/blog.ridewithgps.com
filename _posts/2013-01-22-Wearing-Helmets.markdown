title: "To Wear Or Not to Wear"
---
In the ancient days of lore there were no shields to defend soldiers in battle. Then one day, a brilliant man or women realized that they could block an incoming blow if they carried around a piece of wood and the shield was born. Throughout centuries the shield was perfected and many lives were saved. We can extend this analogy to the modern cyclist, with his helmet being the shield.

Before moving to Colorado in 2011, the only riders I was used to seeing sans helmet were around town commuters. However, once I moved to Colorado that all changed. I was shocked to see so many cyclists riding with naked heads. It has really made me think about the reasons people choose to ride without proper safety gear.

Back in the old days of bike racing, racers didn't wear helmets. As technology progressed and they became lighter, more aerodynamic and most importantly more comfortable, adoption has soared. This brings me to my main point: there is no valid reason to not wear a modern helmet. The main argument I've heard against them is weight. Well, they are so ridiculously light now the argument doesn't hold water. Another reason I've heard is "I'm just not use to wearing one", which can be immediately shot down by pointing out all the other tech on the persons bike they have had to get used to. 

I don't really fault or have issue with someone not wearing one when they ride by themselves. However, if someone showed up helmetless to a group or team ride that I was leading I would not let them participate. It's not safe nor is it fair to anyone else on the ride because if something happens to that person then the entire group has to deal with it.  No ride leader wants to think "if only I had not let them ride without a helmet" for the rest of their days.

The big question I keep coming back to is, why wouldn't you wear a helmet? An explanation that makes sense to me is bravado. You just think your too cool. However, we live in a society where we all have the freedom to make our own decisions, and each person can decide for themselves if wearing a helmet is what they want to do. 

Yes, it's true they may not save your life, but it dramatically increases your chances of surviving the majority of crashes. I've crashed at 40+ mph in a group of 50+ riders and I can tell you one emphatic take away I have from that experience, I will never ride my bike without my helmet. And every time I see someone riding along without one I will always ask myself, why?

Step-by-Step Instructions on how to create a cue sheet from a pre-existing trip.


 1. Open up the trip page, then click the "Copy to my account" link in the right sidebar.
 2. Click the link to the new route, then click the Edit link when the route view page loads.
 3. In the right sidebar, select Add/Remove Control Points.
 4. Click along the route, on the blue ball that follows the mouse, and add points to your route.
 5. Grab and Snap the route back into place between Control Points.  Cues will be generated for the section being 'snapped' to the road.
 7. Save

 Notes: If pay close attention to where the route wonders of the road when snapping the route back into place. The more you zoom in the more control you'll have, and as always be careful to not click on intersections.

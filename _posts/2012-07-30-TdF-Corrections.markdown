After posting the challenge results, it came to our attention (thanks
@fourwhitefeet via Twitter) that we included a couple days of
additional rides in the results.  We will still be distributing prizes
to everyone as recognized in the last results post, but we wanted to
post the corrections to set the record straight, and anyone mentioned
in this post that was not previously mentioned will also receive their
prizes! 

## Completed the Full TdF Challenge, riding 2172.9 miles in 23 days!

* <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/63462">bikenh</a>: 2,175 miles
  (3,500 km). 
* <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/86997">Erco Argante</a>: 2,210
  miles (3,556 km). 
* We initially recognized Two others, <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/95599">Jeffrey
  Timm</a> and <a
  href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/59756">wrightcycle</a>, but with
  the corrected results they barely didn't make it with 2,040.5 and
  1,820.1 miles respectively. Still very impressive! Nice work guys!

## Fastest average speed

* <b>Full TdF</b>: <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/86997">Erco Argante</a>,
  averaging 15.7 mph (25.3 kph) over 2,210 miles (3,556 km). Nice
  work, it was <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/95599">Jeffrey
  Timm</a> before corrections.
* <b>1/2 TdF</b>: <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/71775">Chris
  Dittmore</a>, averaging 18.9 mph (30.4 kph) over 1,436 miles (2,3112
  km). Chris kept his spot and improved his speed from 18.36 to 18.9
  with corrections!
* <b>1/4 TdF</b>: <a
  href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/7564">northEndBent</a>, averaging
  a blazingly-fast _22.9 mph (36.7 kph)_.  Nice increase in speed,
  originally 22.07 mph!
* <b>1/4 TdF runner up</b>: <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/59418">The Digital Jedi</a>
  makes the list for fastest average speed in the 1/4 TdF for a
  standard bike. Let's face it, we can't compete head to head with
  these recumbent riders! The Digital Jedi came impressively close
  though with an average speed of 21.2 mph (34.1 kph).  No change here!

## Highest average VAM

* <b>Full TdF</b>: <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/86997">Erco
  Argante</a> with an average VAM of 506.48 over 2,210 miles (3,556
  km).  No change!
* <b>1/2 TdF</b>: <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/34287">cmc</a> with an
  average VAM of 683.8 over 1,504 miles (2,420 km). It was perryjudd
  before, but with corrections he barely missed the 1/2 challenge miles.
* <b>1/4 TdF</b>: <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/28302">rui
  manuel</a> with an average VAM of 1052.7! Same person with
  corrections, slightly different VAM.

## Most climbing per mile/km

* <b>Full TdF</b>: <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/86997">Erco
  Argante</a> climbed a jaw-dropping 159,225 ft (48,531 m) in a
  similarly impressive 2,210 miles (3,556 km).  This is 72 feet of
  climbing for every mile (or 13.6 meters for every km). What can we
  say though, he rode the actual TdF! Check out <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/trips/803695">this brutal mountain
  stage</a> logged by Erco. No change here!
* <b>1/2 TdF</b>: <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/34287">cmc</a>
  climbed nearly as much as Erco in 700 fewer miles, ascending 158,084
  ft (48184 m) in "only" 1,504 miles (2,422 km). This comes out to an
  impressive 105 feet of climbing for every mile (or 19.9 meters for
  every km). Most of his rides are private, but take a look at <a href="/images/post_images/tdfchallenge_eleprofile.png">the
  elevation profile for his last ride of the challenge</a>. Can't be
  too surprised about winning this category with rides like that! No
  change here either!
* <b>1/4 TdF</b>: <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/6385">Stephen Ax</a> 
  ascended 93,815 ft (28,595 m) in 1,024.6
  miles (1,649 km). That's a lot of climbing, coming out to 91.6 feet per mile (or 17.3 meters
  per km). This is a new result after the corrections, congratulations!

## Join our next challenge!

Our next challenge is starting soon, so come join it! <a
href="http://ridewithgps.com/competitions/Hot-summer-nights">Hot
Summer Nights</a> is all about getting time in the saddle and enjoying
those long hot August days. The challenge will last 3 weeks, (from Aug
4 through Aug 26) and you can choose from 15, 30, or 60 hour
challenges.  The 30 hour challenge works out to being slightly less
demanding than the 1/4 TdF.  We're hoping to motivate the more casual
riders or those with a busy August schedule to at least get out there
with the 15 hour challenge, and for those of you that are ready to
step up and complete something roughly on par with the 1/2 TdF
challenge, join the 60 hour!

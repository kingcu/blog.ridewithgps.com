title: "Site Feature: Jump to Home"

A route creation feature that we have received a lot of requests for is the ability to create a route out to a certain point, and then back to automatically route back to your starting location. So what we did is we added a "Jump to home" feature to the route creation tool. This will allow you to generate a route, and at any point click this link and your route will be routed back to your home in the most direct way possible.

You will want to pay close attention when using this tool to make sure that it doens't route you on a freeway or particularly dangerous route that the tool can't know about.

title: "Cue Sheet, A Great Android App For Navigation"
---

One of our long time users, Geoff Matrangola, grew tired of waiting for an Android bike navigation app.  For the last two years he has been tinkering with his app Cue Sheet, which provides turn guidance for pre-planned routes using the ridewithgps.com [route planner](http://ridewithgps.com/routes/new).  This latest update provides automatic cue advancement, many bug fixes and an updated UI.  Additionally, the latest release has a premium voice guidance package available for $4.

Cue Sheet is easily the best turn guidance app for Android and using it is simple if you already have a Ride With GPS account.  If you have an account on ridewithgps.com but signed up through facebook, you'll need to enabled email/password based login to the site.  Instructions for doing so can be found here: [Enabling email/password login](/blog/2013/04/19/Email-Password-Login).  Once you install the app and input your ridewithgps email+password, you'll get a list of all your pre-planned routes from your account.  Simply draw a new route using your computer, then jump on the app and refresh the route listing to see your most recent map listed.

Geoff appreciates bug reports and suggestions, which can be made through at the [Google Group for Cue Sheet](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/cuesheetapp).

We recommend picking up the pro-version of the app, available as an in-app purchase.  It enables voice activated turn guidance and is currently on sale at an introductory $4 price.

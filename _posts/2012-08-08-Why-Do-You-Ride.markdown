Everyone has an anecdote about why they love to ride. It is these moments that shape us into the type of rider we are. Part of what we find fascinating about bike riding is the story behind the rider, and we want to know yours! 

Send us your story by emailing them to us at <a href="mailto:info@ridewithgps.com&subject=Why I Ride">info@ridewithgps.com</a>.  We will be featuring the best here on the blog.

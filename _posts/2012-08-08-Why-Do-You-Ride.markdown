Everyone has a story, a rime, or a reason as to why they ride a bike. It is typically these reasons that shape us into the type of rider we are too. Part of what we find fascinating about bike riding is the story behind the rider, and we want to know yours! 

Send us your story by emailing them to us at <a href="mailto:info@ridewithgps.com&subject=Why I Ride">info@ridewithgps.com</a> and then well be featuring the best stories here on the blog.

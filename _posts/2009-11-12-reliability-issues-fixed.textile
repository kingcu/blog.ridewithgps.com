Some of you may have noticed some reliability issues over the last two days.  This was due to a package we use in background processing of certain items (your uploaded trips, creating the map images you see around the site) having a couple issues with how we were using it.  I am happy to say that after spending 20 or so hours fixing some stuff, things should be much more stable!

If you see any reliability issues, please let us know as usual.  A little delay in processing your uploaded file, or before a map image is created is normal, but if you see anything pushing past a few minutes give us an email.  Also, re-uploading your TCX/GPX/KML files in this situation will just make duplicates :)  You will know we are working on processing your file by the message on your profile page.

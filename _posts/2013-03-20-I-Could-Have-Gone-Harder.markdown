title: "I Could Have Gone Harder"

<i>After last weeks post on <a href="http://blog.ridewithgps.com/blog/2013/03/12/Getting-Ready-For-A-Century/">Getting Ready For A Century</a>, I decided to talk to a friend of mine who is a coach about mentally preparing for an event. Below is what he had to say.</i>

About a month ago American super runner Galen Rupp set the second fastest American time in the indoor mile at 3:50:92, a second off of Bernard Lagat's record. This was the fifth fastest mile ever in the world and just last week set the new American indoor 3,000 meter record. Galen, by the way, also won the silver medal in the 10,000 meters in London last summer. You're probably asking what this has to do with cycling, I'll get to that. 

I've been racing primarily triathlons and running races the past 9 years with an occasional bike race lightly sprinkled in, both here in the states and in Italy. In those years of racing, there have been several standout events where I can vividly remember being in absolute physical agony trying to beat someone to the finish or meet a personal goal. In my case, more often than not, this seems to happen in the final miles of the run. Without getting into a long explanation of why, I'll just say that I'm proportionately better on the bike than the swim or run. Trying to maximize my performance with a power meter against fellow age group three-sport competitors on the bike is what I usually aim for. 

In 2010 I raced a sprint distance triathlon in Florida against one of my best friends who is also an excellent three-sport athlete. I remember my pre-race plan and even my recorded normalized power on the bike from that day. He's about seven inches taller (thus a great swimmer), so my plan in the swim was to attempt to draft right behind him (totally legal and sometimes encouraged in triathlon). Surprisingly, I was able to get out of the water seconds behind him then quickly chase him down getting out onto the bike course. After passing him on the bike, I kept the effort high and put some good time on him starting out onto the run. It was on the turnaround on the five kilometer run that I knew I was on borrowed time and had to push harder than ever to hold him off. As we got closer to the finish line he caught up to me with about half mile to go and stuck to me like glue. We both put small but seemingly futile surges to try to drop the other. I was in a deep dark painful place with funky abdominal noises happening and the noises of the spectators in the finishing shoot up ahead. Surprisingly, he seemed to slow for a brief moment so I put one last hard surge in - it was a bad decision. In an instant, remnants of my pre-race gel, water and stomach acid came up into my esophagus and up and out of my mouth with about 100 yards to go. Was I at my so called limit for too long? I hit the ground on my knees and kept barfing, he passed me mumbling something in concern. I got back up and tried to chase him down, but repeated the scene surrounded by friends and innocent bystanders. I could see the finish line... 

My friend ended up beating me to the line in that race. To this day we joke about the experience and cherish the memory, both good and gross. For most of us, suffering is an essential part of the sport of cycling, at least at dire moments of chasing a breakaway, surf dogging with friends, individual time trials or even sprint finishes. Achieving personal growth in our sport without some intense moments of discomfort is not as satisfying or interesting. 

Last summer I, like you, watched the Tour de France. Usually for me, this is done when in Italy with a friend or two after eating the typical lunch and lieu of having a siesta. We watch in real time, so it really heats up around 2-4 pm. I remember a french rider, Thomas Voeckler, he was in the yellow jersey for over a week. He tore himself inside out trying to stay at the top into the big climbing stages but inevitably couldn't keep muscling his way to the win. After all, it's more than just pure guts that allows you to win here. My friends in Italy and I joke about Voeckler every year, as he has an almost annoying looking painful grin. We even at times mimic his face when doing group rides. However, I must give him credit for his ability to hurt and motivate his country. 

So, how often do you say "I could have gone harder" after a hard effort, race or fun town line sprint? If you say it often, why? Is it because you realize you had more in the so-called tank? Maybe a better move could have opened up a cleaner line to the finish? It's easy to say, "I could have gone harder," once it's over.

Over the years I've become more interested in the role of the brain in sport. As a coach, I feel it can only help the overall goals of an athlete. It's second nature to take our mind for granted during intense moments of physical exertion and our mind doesn't receive as much recognition as it should. We can set, for example, a pre-specified power range for a time trial, but it's the empirical sensations of pain or joy that are regulated by our brain. The signs of discomfort are registered between our ears - not in our muscles. Pushing our physical boundaries alone is only part of the picture to achieve our goals. Over the years I've become a believer that there's more to fatigue than just mechanical failure of the body and that our brains could have more involvement in that process to regulate balance and act as a buffer to protect our bodies.

Two people that have sparked my interest in this area, are the sometimes controversial Tim Noakes and his Central Governor Theory and author and coach Matt Fitzgerald. Not everyone may agree with their view but I feel there's more to be learned about athletic performance than just physical stress, recovery and adaptation. In order to be a great athlete we need to manipulate our thinking, not just our muscles. We can to a point, once trained, override some of that discomfort and achieve new levels of athletic performance without jeopardizing our well being. 

Back to Galen Rupp. He didn't believe he was ready for the indoor mile, as his coach Alberto Salazar told him to enter only three weeks prior. In his post race interview he was asked about how it went. During the final laps he was unable to hear his coach give him his splits due to the fact of the insanely loud cheers from the crowd, nor did he realize how close he was to the record. He was both elated and surprised at the finish. Was the atmosphere such that it played a distracting role in Galen's amazing performance for his brain to override his physical pain a bit? You be the judge. 

After your next key event or breakthrough workout, take some time to reflect and ask yourself if you could have gone harder; such as my experience racing against my friend, Thomas Voeckler powering his way to hold on to the yellow jersey, Rupp's super fast mile. Was the risk of more discomfort worth the level of reward? This is individual, but I feel once you learn more about the role of the mind in sport performance the outcomes will be much more satisfying and interesting.

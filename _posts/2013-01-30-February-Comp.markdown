It's February which means that spring is right around the corner. We're putting on a little winter base miles competition to help you achieve your fitness goals. This challenge will help you establish a solid base of fitness for a full spring of riding. During the comp post your rides to twitter and use the hashtag #coldmiles. Also, we'd love to see any photos you take while you're out riding, so please post those too.

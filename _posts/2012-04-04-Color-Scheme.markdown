title: "Color Scheme"

One of the things that has bothered us about the Ride With GPS website for a while was how dark and heavy the sites color scheme was. We have worked for quite some time on changing this, and we finally were able to make a change to a new color scheme. 

Old Color Scheme (Profile Page):

Old Color Scheme (Footer):

New Color Scheme (Profile Page):
One of the first things you'll notice we we removed a the dark heavy green and black colors and replaced them with softer more inviting colors.

New Color Scheme (Footer):
We also changed the footer concept and link colors.

We still have a lot of new idea's for making the site look cleaner, but we feel like this is a major first step in the right direction. We hope that you like it!

With Spring here, we decided it was a great time to freshen up our site.  After adding the new logo, we removed some of the darker, oppressive feeling colors from our pages.

Old Color Scheme (Profile Page):

Old Color Scheme (Footer):

New Color Scheme (Profile Page):
One of the first things you'll notice we removed a the dark heavy green and black colors and replaced them with softer more inviting colors.

New Color Scheme (Footer):
We also changed the footer concept and link colors.

We will soon be releasing a new front page featuring a warmer color scheme.  One of our goals this year is to make the site more inviting for anyone who lands on it.  Look forward to more improvements in the near future!

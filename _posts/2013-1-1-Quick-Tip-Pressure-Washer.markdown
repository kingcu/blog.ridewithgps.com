title: "Quick Tip: Pressure Washing!"
---
In some ways bicycles are a lot like cars. They require a lot of upkeep and, for the most part, they are neglected. There's no denying that one of the best things you can do as a car or bicycle owner is preventative maintenance. One of the things I have learned over the last 10 years of being a competitive triathlete and now cyclist is that the best thing you can do on the preventative maintenance front is wash your bike. 

Washing your bike may seem like a basic and easy concept. But this is not always the case. Some mechanics recommend that you wash your bike after every ride. Others say that just keeping your drive-train clean is what's most important. According to them, if you take 15 seconds after every ride to spin the chain through a rag you can dramatically increase the lifetime of your chain, cogs, and cassette--not to mention you'll have a smoother and quieter ride. However, what I found is that this is all way easier said than done. 

There are plenty of limiting factors that can prevent someone from dedicating this type of care to their bike. One of those factors is obvious: time! For those of us who have a full time career, a competitive schedule, and a husband or wife and children, time is always going to be a precious commodity. It's almost always the first excuse we use to avoid taking better care of our bikes. However, there are other limiting factors that I didn't learn about until recently. 

If you currently live in an apartment complex, one of the key tools that you need for washing your bike is not available--a hose! Not surprisingly, you need water and water pressure to be able to sufficiently clean a bike. The best and cheapest way around this conundrum is a 1 gallon pesticide sprayer. 

<img align="right" src="/images/post_images/pesticide_sprayer.jpeg">I like the 1 gallon size because it's small enough to fit under a kitchen sink, and 1 gallon turns out to be the perfect amount of water to clean one to two bikes without having to refill. Another nice part about the sprayer is that you can fill it with super hot water, which on a cold winter day can be the difference between washing your bike and not. Since sprayers are so portable they're also easy to pack in the car for a race, ride, or bike trip. If I drive to the start of a mountain bike ride I don't leave home without the sprayer. I can ride through water and mud during the ride, and use the sprayer to clean off my bike, shoes, and clothes at the trail head when the ride is over. 

Sprayers also super cheap. I bought mine at my local hardware store for around $10. As far as value per dollar spent, it's one of the best tools I have ever bought.

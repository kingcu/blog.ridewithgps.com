title: "Site Updates: Photoviewer Improvements"
---
One of our features that has been needing some improvement for awhile has been our trip photoviewer. There were a few small features that it was just missing and we want it to do a better job of being a story telling piece of your ride. 

The first thing we needed to do was to give users the ability to add captions to their photo's. Also, we wanted to provide thumbnails on the overview page so that someone visiting your trips page could know from the default view if there were photo's. 

<img class="postimage" src="/images/post_images/photoviewer.jpg">

<img class="postimage" src="/images/post_images/overview_thumbnails.jpg">

The other feature that had been missing previously was the ability for the user to go scroll between photo's in the expanded view. Now you can click on the thumbnail and you don't have to close it and click on the next one. You can simple click between the images forwards and back.

We have more improvements planned for photo's, but we're happy to get this first update out.

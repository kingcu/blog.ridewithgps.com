title: "Site Updates: Photoviewer Improvements"
---
One of our features that has been needing some improvement for awhile has been our trip photoviewer. There were a few small features that it was just missing and we want it to do a better job of being a story telling piece of your ride. 

The first thing we needed a better way to add captions to
photos. When you're viewing your photos in the popup, just click on
the caption to edit it in place. Also, we wanted to provide thumbnails on the overview page so
that someone checking out your ride would immediately see that there
were photos.

The other feature that had been missing previously was the ability for
the user to go scroll between photos in the expanded view. Now you can
click on the thumbnail and navigate through all the photos in the
popup by clicking on the photo, or using the arrows above the photo to
navigate forward/backward.

We have more improvements planned for photos, but we're happy to get this first update out.

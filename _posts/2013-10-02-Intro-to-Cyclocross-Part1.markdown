*It's fall and the booming sport of Cyclocross's season just started. For part 1 of our series on Cyclocross we're focusing on providing some tips on how to train for Cross Races. To do so, we reached out to <a href="http://apexcoachingco.com/coaches/grant-holicky/">Grant Holicky</a> who coaches for <a href="http://apexcoachingco.com/">APEX Coaching</a>, and here's what he had to say:*

<h1>Training for Cyclocross</h1>

The growth of Cyclocross in America has enticed many of us to postpone our off season and play in the mud for a few weeks each fall. Easy to get to venues, laid back racing atmospheres and quick 45-60 minute races make this type of bike racing convenient and a lot of fun. So how do you translate your road fitness to the cyclocross course? It's far easier than you think, but it is a different style of racing all together, so there are some simple things that will make a big difference. 

There are two pieces to a successful cross racer. The first key is physiological.  Racing cross is about being able to deliver huge power efforts and then to recover from those efforts while going pretty hard.

<h2>Sprint Power</h2>
Cross starts with an all out sprint to the hole shot. This high end sprint power is essential for a couple reasons in 'Cross. High end power is about speed but it is also a demonstration of strength. You will need this strength repeatedly in the fall, so train for it. We like to take one of our base days each week and include a set of all out 5-10 second sprints. Alternating between standing and seated, take full recovery in between and you will see the overall strength on the bike rise. This will lead to better starts and stronger transitions throughout the race. 

<h2>Recovering During the Race </h2>
Recovery from these efforts is crucial as well and the ability to recover while still going fairly hard is a secret weapon.  Most crossers focus on the short VO2 max efforts in their training and while there is a time and a place, without training at or just below your threshold, you will not be able to recover out of that red zone of pain during a race. Be sure to include some longer sub threshold sessions in your training throughout the season. 20, 10 and 5 min threshold intervals are key elements in any cyclocross racer's training plan. 

The second piece to cross is skills based. Many a large engine has been taken down by a set of barriers or an off camber turn. While your road or mountain bike skills will translate, there are definitely some 'Cross specific skills that require some practice.

<h2>On and Off </h2>
Mounting and dismounting are great places to gain time in a cross race, but they take a committed approach to learn. Find a grass park and get to work. Start very slowly with both the mount and dismount. Begin each practice at half or quarter speed working on the specific actions of the move. As you dial in the details, crank up the speed to race pace. Practice isn't the key to this skill, focused practice, however, is. 

<h2>Trials Skills </h2>
The skills that we typically attribute to trials riding are a big help when maneuvering a 'cross bike around the course. Hopping, track stands and riding tight lines will all serve you well. Take a day each week and just work on your bike handling skills. practicing your bunny hopping or railing some corners while counter-steering brings us back to our younger days of playing on our bikes. It is also a great way to make an easy training day to get faster as a cyclocrosser. In Boulder, we have the luxury of the Valmont Bike Park that is playground for cyclists. Hit up your local bike park or find your own playground. 

The key to Cyclocross is a great attitude. Things are going to go wrong, you are going to get dirty and in many cases you will spend some time rolling in the mud. The more you smile and roll with the punches, the more success you are going to have. Happy barrier hopping!

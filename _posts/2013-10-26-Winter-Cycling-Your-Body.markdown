title: "Winter Cycling - How to Prepare Your Body for a Cold Ride"
---
*As we ease our way into November the days are getting significantly shorter and colder! We focus a lot on our bikes but we thought it would be a good time to turn out attention to our bodies, and specifically how we can best take care of them through the cold months. Our friend Mattew Gibble, Massage Therapist and Owner of <a href="http://www.rainingfaith.com/?utm_source=rwgps&utm_medium=guest-post&utm_campaign=winter-riding">Raining Faith Massage</a> has graciously given all of us some great info. Here's his advice:*

One of the more challenging aspects of winter riding is adequately preparing for a cold weather ride. In stark contrast to the summer months, getting properly dressed and warmed up for a cold ride takes extra time and consideration. Here are some helpful tips that will make transitioning from your house to the open road easier and safer.

Try to avoid jumping right onto your bike and hitting the cold air.  It’s a shock to your central nervous system; your musculature likes to adapt more slowly and intentionally to changes in temperature.  Give yourself fifteen extra minutes to warm up before getting on the bike the body.  But warming up before a ride doesn’t mean stretching!  There’s a difference between stretching and warming up muscle tissue.  This article explains the difference between the two: <a href="http://saveyourself.ca/articles/injury-prevention.php">Injury Prevention</a>

I like to incorporate movements that involve extension and rotation of the spine into my warm up.  Cyclists move in a single sagittal plane on the bike, so it is always good to incorporate other planes of movement when you are off the bike. (On a bike we only move in one plane, the sagittal plane, which is why cyclists tend to be big-muscle-dominant but have trouble firing muscles that work in the two other <a href="http://www.physical-solutions.co.uk/articles/Understanding%20Planes%20and%20Axes%20of%20Movement.pdf">Planes of Movement</a>.)

Always be sure to have some warming embrocation on hand to help warm up your leg muscles. Massage the embrocation into your quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves.  Be sure to adequately work your tendons since they’re not as vascular as muscle bellies.  This includes your hamstrings, the Patellar tendon just below the kneecap, and your Achilles tendon.  I go by an old rule of thumb: if it’s cooler than 68⁰F (20⁰C), wear leg warmers.  You can always peel your leg warmers off as it warms up.  Remember, it’s better to peel down than get caught out there without adequate clothing. 

If, like me, you live in a dry climate such as Colorado, it can be nice to use a nasal rinse before riding so that you can lubricate the sensitive membranes of your nose.  The cold, dry air can be irritating to some.  Another way to reduce nasal irritation is applying a light layer of petroleum jelly to your nostrils, which acts as a lubricant. 

Once you’re out the door, allow your body to warm up slowly before getting into any hard efforts.  Do this by breathing only through your nose for the first ten minutes of the ride.  Feel your lungs fill with air, expanding your rib cage. Feel your abdominal wall move three dimensionally like a cylinder as you inhale, and contract your abdominal wall--drawing your navel toward your spine--as you exhale.  Find a nice rhythm and focus on the movement of your breath.  This will warm the core of your body and, if you have lubricated your nasal passages as mentioned above, will make breathing in the cold air more comfortable.

Once you return home, get out of your clothes and into a hot shower as soon as possible!  I cannot stress this enough .  After you’ve changed and warmed up, take ten minutes to unwind from the flexed position you were in during your ride.  Explore what feels tight or congested and move in a way that helps to open these constricted areas.  Once again, extension and rotational movement will help remind your body that it moves in more than just a sagittal plane.

To finish off, instead of just plopping down on the couch, I like to do a little self-massage to assist in the recovery process so I can do it all over again the next day.

Incorporating some good habits like these into your routine will increase your chances of staying healthy and injury-free during the colder months.

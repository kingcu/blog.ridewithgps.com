Summer Nights</a> 

The TdF Challenge ended on Sunday, and we are thrilled with how it
went! Thank you for being a part of this; it was a lot of fun for
us to watch everyone push themselves and put in long days in the
saddle. Together we rode <b>223,049 miles (358,964 km)</b>!

We've spent the last few days digging through all of your ride data to
come up with a list of riders we'd like to publicly recognize and
award prizes to.

Everyone mentioned below will soon be the proud owner of a Ride with
GPS water bottle, t-shirt, or premium account (or some combination!).

## Completed the Full TdF Challenge, riding 2172.9 miles in 23 days!

* <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/63462">bikenh</a>: 2,175 miles
  (3,500 km). For the first week or two bikenh was the only rider uploading data
  frequently enough to consistently be ahead of the game for the full
  TdF. We watched closely and were absolutely blown away at how much
  riding he did (especially during all the hot weather).
* <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/86997">Erco Argante</a>: 2,210
  miles (3,556 km). He got his miles in by riding in the <a
  href="http://www.tourdeconcorde.org/">Tour de Concorde</a>, where he
  actually rode the full Tour de France! The riders raised over
  100,000 euro to fight cancer. Congratulations Erco!
* <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/95599">Jeffrey Timm</a>: 2,253
  miles (3,627 km). This is the most distance anyone completed, barely
  inching past Erco! Nice work!
* <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/59756">wrightcycle</a>: 2,189
  miles (3,523 km). Back on the podium! Last time we saw wrightcycle
  was when he won our most-miles competition back in April by riding
  681 miles (1096 km) in one week.

## Fastest average speed

* <b>Full TdF</b>: <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/95599">Jeffrey Timm</a>,
  averaging 16.9 mph (27 kph) over 2,253 miles (3,627 km).
* <b>1/2 TdF</b>: <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/71775">Chris
  Dittmore</a>, averaging 18.36 mph (30 kph) over 1,758 miles (2,830
  km). Chris did the TdF while riding across America - good luck on
  the rest of your trip!
* <b>1/4 TdF</b>: <a
  href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/7564">northEndBent</a>, averaging
  a blazingly-fast _22.07 mph (36 kph)_ over 562 miles (905 km)! How
  do you get that fast? On a recumbent! We have quite the community of
  recumbent riders using Ride with GPS, and clearly some of them are
  very fast.
* <b>1/4 TdF runner up</b>: <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/59418">The Digital Jedi</a>
  makes the list for fastest average speed in the 1/4 TdF for a
  standard bike. Let's face it, we can't compete head to head with
  these recumbent riders! The Digital Jedi came impressively close
  though with an average speed of 21.2 mph (34.1 kph). 


## Highest average VAM

* <b>Full TdF</b>: <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/86997">Erco
  Argante</a> with an average VAM of 506.48 over 2,210 miles (3,556
  km). 
* <b>1/2 TdF</b>: <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/102088">perryjudd</a> with an
  average VAM of 788.2 over 1,179 miles (1897 km). Looks like
  perryjudd did his riding in France and Italy, getting this
  impressive VAM figure by doing <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/trips/774141">incredible rides like this one</a>.
* <b>1/4 TdF</b>: <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/28302">rui
  manuel</a> with an average VAM of 1055.8!

## Most climbing per mile/km

* <b>Full TdF</b>: <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/86997">Erco
  Argante</a> climbed a jaw-dropping 159,225 ft (48,531 m) in a
  similarly impressive 2,210 miles (3,556 km).  This is 72 feet of
  climbing for every mile (or 13.6 meters for every km). What can we
  say though, he rode the actual TdF! Check out <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/trips/803695">this brutal mountain
  stage</a> logged by Erco.
* <b>1/2 TdF</b>: <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/34287">cmc</a>
  climbed nearly as much as Erco in 700 fewer miles, ascending 158,084
  ft (48184 m) in "only" 1,504 miles (2,422 km). This comes out to an
  impressive 105 feet of climbing for every mile (or 19.9 meters for
  every km). Most of his rides are private, but take a look at <a href="/images/post_images/tdfchallenge_eleprofile.png">the
  elevation profile for his last ride of the challenge</a>. Can't be
  too surprised about winning this category with rides like that!
* <b>1/4 TdF</b>: <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/users/64396">Kraken</a> 
  did a lot of climbing in July, ascending 46,317 ft (14,117 m) in 557
  miles (896 km). Pretty impressive as it is more climbing per mile
  than the actual TdF, coming out to 83 feet per mile (or 15.7 meters
  per km).

## The lottery! 

Everyone that logged enough miles to qualify for the 1/4 TdF challenge
(a minimum of 543.2 miles or 874.3 km) was entered into a list, and we
generated random numbers to pull out 8 winners for the lottery!
If you're on this list, this means you've won something!

## What's next?

The TdF Challenge was fun, motivating, and inspiring for us. If you
have any stories about your experience with the challenge that you
would like to share, please email us at <a href="mailto:info@ridewithgps.com">info@ridewithgps.com</a>;
we'd love to hear what your experience was like.  

Our next challenge is starting soon, so come join it! <a
href="http://ridewithgps.com/competitions/Hot-summer-nights">Hot
Summer Nights</a> is all about getting time in the saddle and enjoying
those long hot August days. The challenge will last 3 weeks, (from Aug
4 through Aug 26) and you can choose from 15, 30, or 60 hour
challenges.  The 30 hour challenge works out to being slightly less
demanding than the 1/4 TdF.  We're hoping to motivate the more casual
riders or those with a busy August schedule to at least get out there
with the 15 hour challenge, and for those of you that are ready to
step up and complete something roughly on par with the 1/2 TdF
challenge, join the 60 hour!

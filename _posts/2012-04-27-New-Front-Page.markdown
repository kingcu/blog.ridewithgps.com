title: "Site Update: New Homepage"
---
We have felt for a long time that our homepage was not up to snuff, and recently we were able to finally spend some time redesigning it. This fits in with a lot of the other new additions we've made visually to the site, and we think it was the last element that needed to be updated. The new homepage has been out for a few weeks now, but we wanted to document it and give you a closer look!

Above the fold we wanted to capture the motto of our site: "Plan - Ride - Analyze – Compete”. We did so by utilizing four slide images:

<img class="postimage" src="/images/post_images/frontpage_3.jpg">

<img class="postimage" src="/images/post_images/frontpage_4.jpg">

Below the fold we wanted to give a little bit more info about what Ride With GPS offers and how users engage with the site.

Overall we are much happier with the site's front page and the overall look and feel the site now has.

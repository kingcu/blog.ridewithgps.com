We are excited to announce our first Google+ Hangout of the 2013 calendar. This first hangout will be on the topic of route creation. We have launched some new site features since our last hangout on this topic, so we want to go back over it again with you. The new features are super cool, so you're not going to want to miss this one!

The way the hangouts will work is that the first 8 members to join the hangout when it starts will be able to interact with us through their webcam and mic. The rest of the people who join will be able to watch the Hangout live on Youtube and interact through the Hangout's chat feature. If you don't use Google Plus that's okay because you can watch live through Youtube!

title: "April Distance Challenge"

Something that we have been wanting to do for quite some time now is to hold <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/?utm_source=Blog&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=DailyPost">Ride With GPS</a> challenges for our members. We finally have the bandwidth to do so and we are pretty excited about it!

We weren't exactly sure what type to host first, but we settled on an obvious "let's see who can ride the most miles in one week" concept. And now we are on the eve of it's launch.

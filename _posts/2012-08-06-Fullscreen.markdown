title: "Site Update: Full Screen"
---
Last month we released the cool new feature: Full Screen mode! Full screen gives you more viewing space and allows for you to get 100% of your screen for route viewing or editing. 

You will easily be able to use Full Screen by clicking this icon when you see it in the top right of the page: <img src="/images/post_images/fullscreen_icon.png">

You can use full screen on the following pages: 

- route planner
- route/trip views
- segments view
- events view
- activity center.

Currently Full Screen mode isn't supported on:

- Internet Explorer
- Safari

If you want to use Full Screen but you are using one of the above browsers we recommend you switch/upgrade to Google Chrome: <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">download Chrome here!</a>

Here are a couple screen shots of how you go about using Full Screen.

Then when Full Screen is started just click the allow button shown here:

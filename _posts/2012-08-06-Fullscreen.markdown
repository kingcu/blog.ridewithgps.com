title: "Site Update: Full Screen"
---
Last month we released the cool new feature: Full Screen mode! Full screen allows for you to use 100% of your screen for route viewing or editing. 

You can easily use Full Screen by clicking this icon on the top right of the page: <img src="/images/post_images/fullscreen_icon.png">

You can use full screen on the following pages: 

- route planner
- route/trip views
- segments view
- events view
- activity center.

Currently Full Screen mode isn't supported on:

- Internet Explorer
- Safari

If you want to use Full Screen but you are using one of the above browsers we recommend you upgrade to Google Chrome: <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">download Chrome here!</a>

Here are a couple screen shots of how you go about using Full Screen.

When Full Screen is active click the allow button shown here:
